# BlogSite

This is a basic blog site that I built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) and Tailwind CSS. It provides a simple platform for creating, reading, updating, and deleting blog posts.

## Features

- User authentication
- CRUD operations for blog posts
- Responsive design with Tailwind CSS

## Tech Stack

- Frontend: React.js
- Backend: Express.js
- Database: MongoDB
- Styling: Tailwind CSS
This project is also available on Vercel at (https://blog-site-orcin-six.vercel.app).
